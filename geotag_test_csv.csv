Incidentally it was in that year India opened up its economy- and we are enduring its ‘developmental’ aftermath in Bangalore - where it takes, if one ventures, one hour to walk 10 km and the same distance could take by an automobile twice as much time in peak hours. Both have situational warning ‘at one’s own risk and reward’.",https://mod.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG-07_1992.jpg

One of the most charming & pleasant photos , due to it's calm old town relaxed feel along with it's bygone thick tree line on the right. A European in a pith helmet seems to be riding a small horse carriage which is smudged due to slow exposure. Unlike the man on the left who's slowly walking by.
The building in the center with thick square pillar porch which says ""The Bangalore Agency"" also houses the famous South Indian Photographic studio ""Wiele & Klien Studio"" as the board says that for now. Or probably next to it. It also was ""Wiele & co."" & ""Wiele studio"" at different times it was situated in this address of ""# 20 South Parade"". Two buildings before that became The Plaza at # 18. So we sorta get the idea which part of the street this was. Not able to decipher the big building in the distance.
But it also has a resemblence to the Old Spencer & Co with it's front porch looking similar.
The next building Misquith & Co was a Madras firm into importing & selling of musical instruments, which also had branches in Nilgiris, Penang, Ootacamund and Vizagapatnam. It was started by a Portuguese called Misquith who sold it off to another French guy Edgar Allen Prudhome. It still goes on as Musee Musical in Chennai.
Edit: Mr. Anand Kumar has pointed out, the Plaza came up on the plot # 18 right next to The Bangalore Agency building which was on #19. The Wiele & Klien Studio was on # 20 in the neighbouring building before Misquith & Co                                                                                                                                                                                               ",https://mod.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG-09_1908.jpg
